vim ../data/GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.gff
commented out line 8 - "gene" of the whole genome otherwise the vcf was annotated with just that

gff2bed < test.gff > test.bed
bgzip test.bed
tabix -p bed test.bed.gz
bcftools annotate -a test.bed.gz -c CHROM,FROM,TO,GENE -h <(echo '##INFO=<ID=GENE,Number=1,Type=String,Description="Gene name">') ../data/daughter.vcf.gz > ann.vcf

it's fairly inane annotation
with just the "ID=" field from the .gff file

could be better if i used ensembl's version of the ecoli genome
because then could use snpeff which makes some nice visualizations too i think
